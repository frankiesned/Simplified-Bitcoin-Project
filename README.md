# Simplified-Bitcoin-Project
For my networking group project at CSUSM. It was made in python and used Pretty Table for displaying. The program mimics buying and selling bitcoin through a client program and a server program. Course and template were given by Dr. Nahid Majd. The group members include Matt Miller and me.
